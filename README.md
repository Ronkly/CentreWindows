## This project is built with ChatGPT which is why you might not want to install it. This was a disclaimer.
But I at least checked the whole code and undetstood almost everything it contains.

Anyway, this program simply moves the window you're focused on if you press right shift 3 times.
Right now it's a console program and soon I'll make it a proper window that can also be hidden in the **TRAY!!!**
And also it doesn't check if you release Shift.

Hope it helps once I release it!
